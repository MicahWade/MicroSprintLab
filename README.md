# MicroSprintLab

**MicroSprintLab** is a learning tool designed to help coders sharpen their programming skills through short, engaging 1-hour projects. It is especially suited for those learning new programming languages or programming fundamentals.

## Intended Audience

This project targets coders at all levels who want to efficiently build and practice programming skills, particularly learners exploring new languages or starting their programming journey.

## Installation and Usage

### Command Line Version

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MicahWade/MicroSprintLab.git ~/Documents/
cd ~/Documents/MicroSprintLab/
python -m venv venv
```

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Neovim Integration

Start with the **Command Line Version** setup first.

Then enable Neovim integration by changing `nvim` to `true` in `setting.json`.

```bash
cp ~/Documents/MicroSprintLab/microsprintlab.lua ~/.config/nvim/lua/microsprintlab.lua
```

Add the following line to your `init.lua`:

```lua
require("microsprintlab").setup()
```

Within Neovim, run the command:

```
:MicroSprintLab
```

## Contributor Guidelines and Development Notes

- Some code is generated by AI.
- Contributors are encouraged to add ideas to `idea.json` and assist with Lua and Neovim integration.
- Adding support for other editors is welcome, but changes must be fully functional before merging.
- Bugs should be reported with clear reproduction steps.
- Contributors should avoid using AI for code changes and must clearly explain any modifications they make.
